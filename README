shortcircuit-server: URL redirect resolver
==========================================

URL shortening services can track you when you hit their servers to
resolve URLs.  Certain large social networking and social media
companies are particularly devious and create short URLs for all
links posted on or through their service.

`shortcircuit-server` is a server that resolves URLs on behalf of
clients, mitigating some of the privacy issues surrounding URL
shortening.  It is envisioned that browser plugins and libraries for
other kinds of web clients will be able to talk to a shortcircuit
server and avoid resolving short URLs through the provider's own
servers.
